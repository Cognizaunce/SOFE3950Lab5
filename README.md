## Objective
The objective of this lab is to Implement the Banker's Algorithm in a multithreaded C program to control resource allocation among several processes while maintaining system security. The lab's objectives are to examine deadlock situations, show how mutex locks might prevent race circumstances, and confirm that a particular system state is secure. The lab improves knowledge of operating system deadlock avoidance strategies by modelling resource request and release procedures.

## Conclusion
The Banker's Algorithm was successfully applied in this lab to control resource allocation and maintain system security in a multithreaded setting. We showed how the method avoids deadlocks and guarantees equitable resource allocation across several processes by employing mutex locks and closely examining resource requests. The findings reaffirmed the significance of deadlock avoidance strategies in operating systems by confirming that the system only provides resource requests when they do not result in an unsafe condition. All things considered, this implementation demonstrates how well the Banker's Algorithm handles the safe and effective allocation of concurrent resources.
