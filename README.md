## Objective
The objective of this lab is to Implement the Banker's Algorithm in a multithreaded C program to control resource allocation among several processes while maintaining system security. The lab's objectives are to examine deadlock situations, show how mutex locks might prevent race circumstances, and confirm that a particular system state is secure. The lab improves knowledge of operating system deadlock avoidance strategies by modelling resource request and release procedures.
